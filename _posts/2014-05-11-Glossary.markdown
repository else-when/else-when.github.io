Past few weeks, E Roon and I have been working with Nick Irvin, research assistant for the project, on rewriting project description and conceptualizing direction of the project. Thanks to Nick, we were able to make visibile progress. After many revisions, we collected glossary of words and phrases to define some ambigious points in project description. Making the list of terms also provided an opportunity to engage in conversation about the project in different perspective. Here is a preliminary list of glossary. To observe work in progress of full list, check out this <a href="https://hackpad.com/Elsewhen-Glossary-oHUuh0aIktI"> scatch pad.</a>

“Jet lag describes the site of love as time in which one is alone, e.g. awake alone in the night, socially less compatible and in this time-space of aloneness one can love and be loved without a division of self and the other.” Towards Haegue Yang’s Blind Rooms by Max Andrews <a href="http://www.lttds.org/assets/Andrews-HaegueYang-ENGL.pdf"> link </a>
